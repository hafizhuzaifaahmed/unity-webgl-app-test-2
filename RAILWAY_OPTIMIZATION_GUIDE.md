# Railway Performance Optimization Guide for Unity WebGL

## üöÄ Implemented Optimizations

### 1. **HTTP Compression (60-80% size reduction)**
- Added `compression` middleware with gzip/brotli support
- Reduces WASM and data file transfer sizes dramatically
- **Expected improvement: 3-5x faster initial load**

### 2. **Aggressive Browser Caching**
- Set `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` for build files
- After first load, subsequent visits load instantly from browser cache
- **Expected improvement: Near-instant repeat visits**

### 3. **Resource Preloading**
- Added `<link rel="preload">` for critical Unity files
- Browser starts downloading files before JavaScript executes
- **Expected improvement: 20-30% faster initial load**

### 4. **Optimized Static File Serving**
- Enabled ETags and Last-Modified headers
- Immutable flag for build files
- **Expected improvement: Better CDN edge caching**

## üìä Performance Comparison

### Before Optimization:
- WASM file: ~50-100MB (uncompressed)
- Data file: ~50-100MB (uncompressed)
- Total transfer: ~150-200MB
- Load time: 30-60 seconds on Railway

### After Optimization:
- WASM file: ~10-30MB (compressed)
- Data file: ~10-30MB (compressed)
- Total transfer: ~30-60MB (first visit)
- Total transfer: ~0MB (cached visits)
- **Expected load time: 8-15 seconds on Railway (first visit)**
- **Expected load time: 2-3 seconds (cached visits)**

## üîß Additional Railway-Specific Optimizations

### Option 1: Use Railway's CDN (Recommended)
Railway automatically provides CDN edge caching. Your current setup will benefit from:
- Global edge locations
- Automatic SSL/TLS
- DDoS protection

### Option 2: Increase Railway Resources
In Railway dashboard:
1. Go to your service settings
2. Under "Resources" tab
3. Increase to:
   - **vCPU: 2-4** (for faster compression)
   - **RAM: 2-4GB** (for better caching)
   - You don't need 32 vCPU/32GB for a static file server

### Option 3: Enable Unity WebGL Compression in Build Settings
In Unity Editor before building:
1. Go to `Edit > Project Settings > Player > Publishing Settings`
2. Set `Compression Format` to **Brotli** (best) or **Gzip**
3. Rebuild your WebGL project
4. **This can reduce file sizes by 80-90% before server compression**

### Option 4: Use Unity's Data Caching
In your Unity build settings:
1. Enable `Data Caching`
2. This stores assets in browser IndexedDB
3. Subsequent loads are much faster

## üåê Network Optimization Tips

### 1. Check Railway Region
- Ensure your Railway deployment is in the region closest to your users
- US-West, US-East, EU-West are common options
- **This can reduce latency by 100-300ms**

### 2. Monitor Network Performance
Use browser DevTools (F12):
```
Network tab > Check:
- Content-Encoding: gzip or br (compression working)
- Cache-Control headers (caching working)
- Transfer size vs Resource size (compression ratio)
```

### 3. Test with Throttling
In Chrome DevTools:
- Network tab > Throttling dropdown
- Test with "Fast 3G" or "Slow 3G"
- This simulates real-world conditions

## üìà Expected Results

### Local Server (Baseline):
- Latency: 0-5ms
- Bandwidth: 1000+ Mbps
- Load time: 2-5 seconds

### Railway (After Optimization):
- Latency: 20-100ms (depends on region)
- Bandwidth: 100-500 Mbps (Railway CDN)
- **First load: 8-15 seconds** (60-70% of local speed)
- **Cached load: 2-3 seconds** (similar to local)

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Deploy these changes to Railway**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add compression and caching optimizations"
   git push
   ```

2. **Test the improvements**
   - Clear browser cache
   - Open DevTools Network tab
   - Load your Railway URL
   - Check "Content-Encoding" and transfer sizes

3. **If still slow, consider:**
   - Rebuilding Unity project with Brotli compression
   - Using smaller texture sizes in Unity
   - Reducing audio quality in Unity
   - Splitting large assets into AssetBundles

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If compression isn't working:
- Check Railway logs for errors
- Verify `compression` package is installed
- Check response headers in browser DevTools

### If caching isn't working:
- Clear browser cache completely
- Check Cache-Control headers
- Ensure build file names are unique (versioned)

### If still slower than local:
- This is expected due to network physics
- Local = 0ms latency, Railway = 20-100ms latency
- Focus on making repeat visits fast with caching
- Consider Unity build optimizations (biggest impact)

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Unity Build Size is Key**: Server optimizations help, but reducing Unity build size at source is most effective
2. **Caching Wins Long-term**: First visit may be slower, but cached visits should be near-instant
3. **Monitor Real Users**: Use Railway analytics to see actual user load times
4. **Progressive Loading**: Consider loading Unity scenes progressively instead of all at once

## üìû Support

If you need further optimization:
- Check Railway's performance metrics dashboard
- Use Lighthouse audit in Chrome DevTools
- Profile with Chrome Performance tab
- Consider Unity Addressables for large projects
