# Build Deployment Guide - No Downloads, No Browser Cache

## üéØ Overview

This guide shows you how to deploy your Unity WebGL build to Railway **without**:
- ‚ùå Downloading files during Railway build (slow, unreliable)
- ‚ùå Relying on browser cache (users restart browsers)
- ‚úÖ Files served directly from Railway server (fast, reliable)

## üì¶ **Option 1: Commit Build Files Directly (Recommended)**

### Step 1: Remove Git LFS Tracking

```bash
# In your project directory
git lfs untrack "Build/*.wasm"
git lfs untrack "Build/*.data"

# Update .gitattributes
# Remove or comment out these lines:
# Build/*.data filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
# Build/*.wasm filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
```

### Step 2: Commit Actual Build Files

```bash
# Remove LFS pointer files
git rm --cached Build/deployment_1_1.wasm
git rm --cached Build/deployment_1_1.data

# Add actual binary files
git add Build/deployment_1_1.wasm
git add Build/deployment_1_1.data
git add Build/deployment_1_1_framework.js
git add Build/deployment_1_1_loader.js

# Commit
git commit -m "Add Unity build files directly (no LFS)"
git push
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Railway

Railway will now use the files directly from your repository. No downloads needed!

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Instant builds (no download time)
- ‚úÖ 100% reliable (no connection failures)
- ‚úÖ Simple setup

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Large repository size (~172MB)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slower git operations

---

## üì¶ **Option 2: Use Build Archive (build.zip)**

### Step 1: Create build.zip

```bash
# In your project directory
cd Build
zip -r ../build.zip .
cd ..

# Verify
ls -lh build.zip
```

### Step 2: Add to Repository

```bash
# Add build.zip to git
git add build.zip

# Update .gitignore to exclude Build files but keep build.zip
echo "Build/*.wasm" >> .gitignore
echo "Build/*.data" >> .gitignore
echo "Build/*.js" >> .gitignore
echo "!build.zip" >> .gitignore

git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add build.zip for Railway deployment"
git push
```

### Step 3: Railway Auto-Extracts

The `setup-build.sh` script automatically extracts `build.zip` during deployment.

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Compressed archive (smaller than raw files)
- ‚úÖ Fast extraction on Railway
- ‚úÖ Clean repository

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Still ~100MB+ in repository
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to update build.zip when Unity build changes

---

## üì¶ **Option 3: Use External Storage (Advanced)**

### Use Cloudflare R2, AWS S3, or similar

1. **Upload Build files to cloud storage**
2. **Update setup-build.sh to download from your storage**
3. **Use CDN for faster global delivery**

See `DEPLOYMENT_ALTERNATIVES.md` for detailed instructions.

---

## üöÄ **Current Setup (After My Changes)**

I've updated your project to:

1. **nixpacks.toml**: Now runs `setup-build.sh` instead of downloading from GitHub
2. **setup-build.sh**: Checks for build files in this order:
   - Existing Build files in repo ‚úÖ
   - build.zip in repo ‚úÖ
   - Falls back to error (no downloads)

3. **server.js**: Disabled browser caching
   - Files served fresh from server each time
   - No dependency on user's browser cache
   - Compression still enabled for faster transfer

---

## üìã **Recommended Approach**

### For Your 172MB Build:

**Short-term (Quick Fix):**
```bash
# Create and commit build.zip
cd Build
zip -r ../build.zip .
cd ..
git add build.zip setup-build.sh nixpacks.toml
git commit -m "Use build.zip for Railway deployment"
git push
```

**Long-term (Best Performance):**
1. Optimize Unity build with Brotli compression (reduces to 20-40MB)
2. Commit optimized files directly to repository
3. Fast builds, fast loading, small repository

---

## üîß **How It Works Now**

### Railway Build Process:
```
1. Railway pulls your git repository
2. Runs setup-build.sh
3. Script checks for Build files or build.zip
4. Extracts if needed
5. Starts server with files ready
```

### User Loading Process:
```
1. User visits your Railway URL
2. Server sends compressed files (gzip/brotli)
3. Files load directly from Railway server
4. No browser caching (works even after browser restart)
5. Compression reduces transfer size by 60-80%
```

## üìä **Performance Comparison**

| Method | Build Time | Load Time | Reliability |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Download from GitHub LFS** | 5-10 min | 10-20s | ‚ùå Fails often |
| **build.zip (current)** | 30s | 10-20s | ‚úÖ Reliable |
| **Direct commit** | 10s | 10-20s | ‚úÖ Very reliable |
| **Optimized Unity + direct** | 10s | 3-5s | ‚úÖ Best |

---

## üéØ **Next Steps**

1. **Create build.zip:**
   ```bash
   cd Build
   zip -r ../build.zip .
   cd ..
   ```

2. **Commit and deploy:**
   ```bash
   git add build.zip
   git commit -m "Add build.zip for deployment"
   git push
   ```

3. **Verify on Railway:**
   - Check build logs for "‚úÖ Build files extracted successfully"
   - Test your app loads correctly
   - No more download failures!

4. **Optional - Optimize Unity build:**
   - See `UNITY_BUILD_OPTIMIZATION.md`
   - Enable Brotli compression in Unity
   - Reduce 172MB to 20-40MB
   - Much faster loading for users

## ‚ùì **FAQ**

**Q: Why not use browser cache?**
A: Users restart browsers, clear cache, or use incognito mode. Server-side is more reliable.

**Q: Won't this be slow without caching?**
A: Server compression (gzip/brotli) reduces transfer by 60-80%. With optimized Unity build, it's very fast.

**Q: What about Redis cache?**
A: Not needed. Railway's server memory and compression are sufficient. Redis adds complexity without much benefit for static files.

**Q: Repository is too large with build files?**
A: Use build.zip (compressed) or optimize Unity build first. Or use external storage (Option 3).

**Q: How do I update the build?**
A: 
- **With build.zip**: Recreate zip and commit
- **Direct files**: Just commit new Build files
- Railway auto-deploys on git push
